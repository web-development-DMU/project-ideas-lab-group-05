    <h1>Joel Ngabesong</h1>

<p>
    Before today, (10/2/2026) I had written 20 lines max of HTML and have only made an extremely basic website.
</p>

<p>
    However I am still quite eager to learn web development and obtain practical skills as a programmer.

<h2> My application ideas</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Weather/Climate application
        This app could either tell the weather for a certain amount of days, or give the climate for every country.
    </li>

    <li>
        Calendar application
        This app would display the calendar for the next few years. THe user could also be able to set events for each day.
    </li>
</ul>
