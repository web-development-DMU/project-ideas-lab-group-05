        <h1>Ijugin</h1>
        <p>I have basic experience in web development. I can create simple web pages using HTML, including text, images, links, and basic layout. Although my experience is not advanced, I understand how HTML forms the foundation of a website.</p>
        <p>In this module, I’m hoping to learn how to build more complete and professional‑looking websites. I want to understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together, and I’d like to gain confidence in creating pages that look good and function properly. My goal is to move from basic HTML pages to more polished, modern web designs.</p>
